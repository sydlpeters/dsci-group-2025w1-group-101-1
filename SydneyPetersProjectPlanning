**Problem**: Predicting Usage of a Video Game Research Server

"A research group in Computer Science at UBC is collecting data about how people play video games. They have set up a MineCraft serverLinks to an external site., and players actions are recorded as they navigate through the world. But running this project is not simple: they need to target their recruitment efforts, and make sure they have enough resources (e.g., software licenses, server hardware) to handle the number of players they attract."
